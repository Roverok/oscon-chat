# OSCon Chat

This is the chat example for my OSCon talk on 26/07/11 titled "Writing a Chat
Server with Socket.IO".

Unlike other chat examples, each browser client gets 1 chat screen, and they
talk 1-on-1 with an "admin".

## Setting it up

1. Install Node.JS and NPM.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Run `npm install .`.
4. Run `node app.js`.
5. Point your browser to `http://localhost:3000` and
   `http://localhost:3000/admin` for the admin interface.
